Hi Coders !
Shamsiya here, I describe myself as a "Woman Who Code." On the internet, I’m shamsiya00 (with two zeros). After 4 years of software engineering I got to know that I’m more into coding, but I still love designing. I love what I do and try my best to help others find a way to do what they love.
